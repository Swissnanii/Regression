# Regression Project: Micro Gas Turbine Electrical Energy

# What is the objective of this project?
The goal of this project is to see how time and power correlate to input voltage

# Where is the data from?
The dataset in this project is from the UCI repository **repository link [UCI] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/994/micro+gas+turbine+electrical+energy+prediction. The dataset, consists of measurements of electrical power corresponding 
to an input control signal over time, collected from a 3-kilowatt commercial micro gas turbine.

# Model Performance
- MAE: 11.0743
- RMSE: 12.3306
- R2 Score: 0.99%

# Feature Importance 
**Input_voltage**
- This was the most important feature by far as the voltage went up so did the power
